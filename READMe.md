# Coupled Oscillators Simulator

A Python library for simulating and analyzing the motion of coupled oscillators using Newtonian mechanics. This project abstracts the complexity of motion analysis into a clean, object-oriented framework, enabling users to visualize oscillatory dynamics, tweak physical parameters, and generate audio from sub-frequency oscillations.
